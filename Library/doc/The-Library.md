# Library

The task is to simulate a library for a combination of works such as books, games, movies, etc.

## Requirements

 1. There are at least 3 types of works (eg book, CD, film, game) that can be stored in the library, and they have some common attributes (eg id, title, purchase price) and some different attributes (eg number of pages, play time).
 2. You can register new works that are added to the library's catalog. It asks for different attributes depending on which type of work it is.
 3. You can list all the works that are in the catalog for each work summarized information about it is displayed.
 4. You can save and load the library's catalog from a file or database.
 5. The code is object-oriented.

## Extended requirements

1. You can search for free text in the catalog and sort the catalog in different ways.
2. You can calculate the value of the entire collection based on the fact that each work has a method that indicates its value. The method to calculate the value can be decided by yourself but it needs to be different for each type of work.
3. You can have several copies of a work. The copies have most in common (eg number of pages) but have an attribute that can distinguish them (eg one copy can be in damaged condition, another in new condition).
4. You can borrow a copy of a work in the library from and to a date and it is not possible to borrow a work that is already borrowed during the selected period.
5. You can send reminders to those who have not returned their works after the last date (use a real method such as ex. email or a simulated method).
